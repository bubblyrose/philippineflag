<strong> # Philippine Flag </strong>

hey! this is my first ever <i>CSS-ART!</i><br>
took me 3 trials to see what I wanted. 

It's very simple.

I enjoyed making it and learning new stuff.<br>
I hope that I will improve from here.

My goal is to become a reliable web-developer someday.

A little help?
